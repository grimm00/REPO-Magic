### Parsing Notes (Think Mode)
- We search for comments using the header pattern '### Comment N'
- Location is taken from the first '<location>...</location>' tag, then HTML tags and backticks are stripped, and whitespace is trimmed
- Type is the first bold '**...**' phrase; trailing colons are removed to normalize values like 'suggestion:' -> 'suggestion'
- Description is the first non-empty, non-bold line between '<issue_to_address>' and the next code fence, with markdown tokens removed

**suggestion:** Manual confirmation step may block automation.

Consider adding a flag or environment variable to bypass the manual prompt for CI or automated workflows.

**suggestion (bug_risk):** Secrets are set without checking for existing values.

This approach may unintentionally overwrite existing secrets. Please add a check for existing values and log or prompt before overwriting.

```suggestion

    set_github_secret() {
        local secret_name="$1"
        local secret_value="$2"

**suggestion:** Hardcoded URLs may reduce flexibility.

Consider making these URLs configurable through environment variables or config files to improve portability.

<issue_to_address>
**suggestion:** Temporary branch protection files are created in project root.

Using the project root for temporary files may cause clutter or file conflicts. Please use a temp directory or ensure thorough cleanup.

Suggested implementation:

```
    # Create a temporary directory for branch protection configuration files
    BRANCH_PROTECTION_TMP_DIR="$(mktemp -d)"
    trap 'rm -rf "$BRANCH_PROTECTION_TMP_DIR"' EXIT

    cat > "$BRANCH_PROTECTION_TMP_DIR/branch_protection_main.json" << 'EOF'

  "required_status_checks": {
    "strict": true,
    "contexts": ["test"]
  },
  "enforce_admins": true,
  "required_pull_request_reviews": {
    "required_approving_review_count": 1
  },
  "restrictions": null
}
EOF

```

If other parts of the script reference `$PROJECT_ROOT/branch_protection_main.json`, update them to use `$BRANCH_PROTECTION_TMP_DIR/branch_protection_main.json` instead.

**suggestion:** Branch up-to-date check does not handle diverged branches.

Comparing commit hashes only detects exact matches. Use 'git status' or 'git rev-list' to determine if the branch is ahead or behind for a more accurate check.

```suggestion
    # Check if branch is up to date
    if gh_remote_branch_exists "$current_branch"; then
        local ahead_count=$(git rev-list --count HEAD ^origin/"$current_branch")
        local behind_count=$(git rev-list --count origin/"$current_branch" ^HEAD)

        if [ "$ahead_count" -eq 0 ] && [ "$behind_count" -eq 0 ]; then
            gh_print_status "SUCCESS" "Branch is up to date with remote"
        elif [ "$ahead_count" -gt 0 ] && [ "$behind_count" -eq 0 ]; then
            gh_print_status "WARNING" "Branch is ahead of remote by $ahead_count commit(s)"
        elif [ "$ahead_count" -eq 0 ] && [ "$behind_count" -gt 0 ]; then
            gh_print_status "WARNING" "Branch is behind remote by $behind_count commit(s)"
        else
            gh_print_status "ERROR" "Branch has diverged from remote (ahead by $ahead_count, behind by $behind_count)"
