# Git Workflow Test

This file was created to test the new Git workflow:

## Branch Structure Test
- âœ… Created `develop` branch from `main`
- âœ… Created `feature/test-workflow` from `develop`
- âœ… Pushed `develop` to GitHub
- ðŸ”„ Testing feature branch workflow

## Next Steps
1. Make changes on this feature branch
2. Create pull request: `feature/test-workflow` â†’ `develop`
3. Test the complete workflow
4. Delete this test file after workflow validation

## Workflow Benefits
- **Isolation**: Features developed independently
- **Review**: All changes go through pull requests
- **Stability**: `main` branch remains stable
- **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work simultaneously
- **Rollback**: Easy to revert problematic features
